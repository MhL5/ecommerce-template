# Next.js: ALWAYS read docs before coding

Before any Next.js work, find and read the relevant doc in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`. Your training data is outdated — the docs are the source of truth.

## What I need from you

- End every turn where you're blocked on me, or where the next step needs me, with a short "**What I need from you**" section. Numbered, one concrete action or decision per item: exactly what to do, where (which site, app, file or person), and what to send back. e.g. "Open the Convex dashboard, add `OPENAI_API_KEY` under Settings → Environment Variables, then reply 'done'", not "I need the API key set up".
- If there are several, put the quickest or most blocking one first, and say what you'll get on with in the meantime.
- If you don't need anything from me, say "Nothing needed from you right now", and say whether the work is finished or still going.
- Never bury a request for me in the middle of a long update.

## When to stop and ask me

- When something is unclear or you're unsure
- before anything destructive: deleting data, force-pushing, or changing anything outside this repository
